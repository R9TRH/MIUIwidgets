Port MIUI 14 widgets to any MIUI 12.5+ A11+
 
Project is made by TRH,
From I.R. Iran


# IMPORTANT NOTES

‚ö†Ô∏è Uninstall any MODULE related to launcher, app vault, weather and Themes first
(or if you want keep using sipollo launcher use v5.x only, but anyways launcher inside my module is modded.)

‚ö†Ô∏è UNINSTALL UPDATES FOR THOSE 4 APPS  (Otherwise bootloop/issues)

‚ö†Ô∏è Maybe you need set app vault permissions in app settings, or set it as -1 screen and open it once to authorize it

‚ö†Ô∏è You must open the themes app once to authorize it, then you can add widgets to home screen.

‚ö†Ô∏è If some widgets are in Chinese, change phone language to English US.

‚ö†Ô∏èNOTE: DON'T UPDATE Launcher, WEATHER, APP VAULT  AND THEMES APP MANUALLY. I'LL POST UPDATES AS A MODULE
(MIUI China Users can only update weather app)
