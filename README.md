# IMPORTANT NOTES
I'll update module so keep joining here

⚠️ Uninstall any MODULE related to launcher, app vault, weather and Themes first
(or if you want keep using other modded launcher use v5.0 (https://t.me/MiuiWidgets/193) only, but anyways launcher inside my module is modded.)

⚠️ UNINSTALL UPDATES FOR THOSE 4 APPS 

⚠️ Maybe you need set app vault permissions in app settings, or set it as -1 screen and open it once to authorize it

⚠️ You must open the themes app once to authorize it, then you can add widgets to home screen.

⚠️ If some widgets are in Chinese, change phone language to English US.

⚠️NOTE: DON'T UPDATE LAUNCHER, WEATHER, APP VAULT AND THEMES APP MANUALLY. I'LL POST UPDATES AS A MODULE
(MIUI China Users can only update weather app)

⚠️Fix CAN'T CONNECT / some widgets not download
   Disable Any AdBlock / Host / net limit things
   
⚠️ Fix Security Widgets' bugs (https://t.me/MiuiWidgets/224)

ℹ️ Some widgets are ROM based. For example, security privacy widget not work on non-china ROMs
